Mini Assignment Reflection:

	  I have to say the hardest thing about this assignment was learning how to work with QT, but other than that it wasn’t too bad. I had a strong start with it, when it came to programming the buttons. There was hitch when it came to figuring out how to implement the whole evaluating expressions bit, but I figured it out after reading through some documentation.
	  Honestly, I was thrilled when I finally got it all working. Calculators are so common in our lives, so it was cool to see how one might be made, even if it was a basic one. If I’d had the time to do anything differently, I probably would’ve added a clear button or something of the sort. Unfortunately, I’ve got a bunch of other assignments that I need to get done, so time isn’t really something I have right now. Maybe I’ll go back later and add one just for the fun of it. So yeah. This was a cool little side project, and I’m looking forward to working more with QT.
